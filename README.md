# Habbo: Battle Royale

Habbo Battle Royale is a (in-development) web-based virtual-world multiplayer game. The idea behind the project is to use the concept of Habbo Hotel, creating a whole new environment with the battlers joining a virtual-world where they fight to be the last one alive. When you're connected to a game, you will be spawned in a random statically set position of the map. The map consists out one single main "Habbo Hotel room", with different areas where the weather may differ - rain at one place, thunder storm at another, shining at a third place, and so on.
